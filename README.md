# SafranTech AI – Health AI (2024)

This repository contains the 2024 **Health AI** project by SafranTech AI team, developed for the Teknofest / TÜBİTAK competition.  
The theme was **breast cancer detection / diagnosis using AI** (some sources refer to it as “AI-supported breast cancer diagnosis”). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

**Achievement:** Ranked **13th among 56 teams** in Türkiye in that year’s contest.
