# SafranTech AI – Health AI (2024)

This repository contains the 2024 **Health AI** project by the **SafranTech AI** team, developed for the **Teknofest / TÜBİTAK competition**.  
The theme was **breast cancer detection / diagnosis using AI** (sometimes referred to as *“AI-supported breast cancer diagnosis”*).  

**Achievement:** Ranked **13th among 56 teams** in Türkiye in that year’s contest.  
I served as the **team captain** and **head of the software division** during this project.

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Investigate the effectiveness of AI in diagnosing breast cancer  
- Leverage **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to build a model with high accuracy and robustness  
- Contribute to AI in healthcare, particularly in **early cancer detection**  

The CNN model was trained using **over 10,000 DICOM (.dcm) files** provided by **TÜBİTAK**.  

> ⚠️ Note: These medical imaging files were used during training but **will not be shared publicly**.
